 ### Jan 18, 2021  Orange marmalade

Second batch of Orange marmalade:

* ~2 lb oranges, zest and flesh (discard pith) to make 800g product.
* 2 lemons, same treatment
* 2C sugar
* 2C water

Cook to desired stage.  I had no luck measuring temp with any probes that I have.  Stopped when the texture seemed right and the mixture set on a cold plate.  Better to use metal surface than cold plate!  I may have taken this too far.  Next time take out samples to cool as setting temp is approached.  This quantity made 1.5 pints.  Gotta love the mixed units.
