### MIDI Readme

Documenting some Arduino code:

* Code for Arduino mega2560 that sends on/off on a single note: [file link](./midi_mega2560_simple.ino)
* Code for a USB native board, like the Metro M0 from Adafruit: [file link](./MIDI_7_notes.ino)
* Code that acts as a bridge between UART on mega2560 and the USB MIDI of the Metro M0: [file link](./MIDI_bridge_1.ino)
