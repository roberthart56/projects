R and C met to update each other on progress and to make noise.
updates:
- R can drive Hauptwerk sounds from Arduino board. 
- C brought pedalboard to church. R and C discussed logistics of adding Hall sensors to pedalboard.
- C acquired midi interface and together R and C were able to calibrate both Keytar controller and lower manual of combo organ and successfully drove Hauptwerk on laptop.
next steps:
- R may open Rodgers console to see about sending sound to loft speakers
- C will acquire MEGA2560 arduino board (likely has enough pins for our final project) and familiarize self with Arduino IDE
- C will consult combo organ owners manual and get both keyboards sending midi info.
- R will try to work up demo of Hall sensor / magnet setup on pedals.

 - C thinks we should document our process with short vid / sound clips and photos. 
 These might be of interest to Loaves and Fishes as well as other who undertake midifying their own parish organ.
