# Injecting light into vials.  

Worked on Barbara's vials, installing a red LED in one.  Here are some notes:
 * Used Dad's tiny manipulating tools and his microscope.
 * Made soldering jig from Oomoo25. Great idea, but need stiffer material.  Probably sacrifice a cooking utensil!
 * Soldering easier than expected.  Used small tip.  No extra flux.
 * inject with 1.2mm needle.   Pull LED and wires into needle from tip side.  When needle is inserted, push wires in, and withdraw needle.
 * 100 Ohm resistor in series gives approx 30mA, the maximum specced current for this LED. (0402, Digikey 732-11991-1).

I sent this off to Barbara, attached to a stiff cardboard backing, with USB connector soldered.  Very delicate since wires are not strain-relieved.  Hope it survives the trip.



### Before and after Christmas.  Dec 23 - Jan. 6 2021.

Put together a prototype ornament, making progress on soldering and placing LEDs in vials.

 * Remove insulation from thin enamalled wire using abrasive paper pieces.  About 400 grit works well.  Rub paper together, rotating wire between and abrading enamel.  This seems cleaner than burning.  Wire gauge is 47?  Diameter 0.004".  This is about what's needed since needle bore is ~ 0.75mm = 0.030"  LEDs are size 0402 (0.040"x0.020").  Of course, this would all be easier with a larger needle, but I think that might be missing the point, whatever it is. [sic]

 * As a clamp, use part of a silicone soldering mat from the HTMAA kit 2020.  this is stiffer than the oomoo25, and holds parts and wires for soldering.  Manipulate with tweezers under microscope.  A better rig could be made, allowing more controlled placement.  Use hot air rework tool from HTMAA kit soldering station for heating parts to tin with solder.  Then juxtapose and use small soldering tip to fuse the LED and wire together.  It works with some practice.  Not easy, but I can now solder a couple in an hour.  A better approach may be to use soldering paste, put it all together in a specialized silicone jig, and solder with hot air.

 * Here's a picture of LED soldered up and inserted into needle.  I prepared the vil by inserting a needle, rinsing out residual saline with tap water, and heating the vial for a few hours, with needle still inserted.  This enlarged the hole - not as nice.  could fill vial with mineral oil.  I wonder how this would look, as refractive index would be closer to the LED encapsulant's.

  * Picture of the ornament and its board and battery.  There are two LEDs - red and green.  Used an Arduino micro (A 328 with USB) with an Adafruit 350 mA-hour LiPo battery.  Requires a 3.7 Volt charger, shown alongside in the picture.  I attempted to use shrink tube to protect four LED wires. Resistors are 100 ohm - could be tweaked for two colors to tradeoff brightness and battery time.  I could make a microcontroller board smaller than the battery pack, possibly with charger included.  I'd use a tiny412.  Not sure this is worthwhile, since the leads are so delicate that the ornament will probably not last.
