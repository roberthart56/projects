          <p>On scope trace, green=CS, yellow=CK, Blue=MOSI, purple=MISO.  Necessary to pull /RESET pin high in order for it to work.
            Not necessary to pull /WP pin high, but it may not be a bad idea on the next board design to do so. </p>
          <p>This program sends write enable command, then reads status register 1.  Return is 0x02 - only the write enable bit is high.  Note one too many falling edges on scope trace
          Note that it takes ~7 microseconds between clk clear and set, while if statement is being evaluated.  Surprising
        to me that it takes so long.  Why?  Better in assembly?  Quicker to use USI?</p>

                to write commands and addresses.  Incorporate "read status" function into the read function? Actuall, it's time to think about
                function structure.  Maybe write a function to trade bytes that is called as needed by other functions.

                <p>Scope picture shows command on MOSI (Blue) to read, followed by three-byte address.  Two bytes
                are read (purple) on MISO.  Time to write a byte: 50 usec.  Time to read byte: 34 usec, depending on bit value.  Why so long??

                  Here's the fragment of the program.  The time between clearing SCK and setting it in the top
                  of the loop is 4-9 microseconds at a clock speed of 8MHz.  Why?</li>

                  <li>locations must be erased in order to be written.  No overwriting. Writing takes ~50 usec per byte. (with overhead).</li>
                  <li>With this c-program, read time ~33 usec per byte (with overhead).</li>

            next step can be either to use USI for faster trades, or speed up the loop using assembly tools. B01 uses a byte_trade function

                  around 260 microseconds.  Each bit now takes ~4microseconds, with time for CK high 1.7-2.2 microseconds.  Cuts the total time in half by reducing the time that
                    ck is low.  Next, remove the 1 microsecond bit delays to speed up more.<br>
