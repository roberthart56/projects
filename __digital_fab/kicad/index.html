###Kicad notes

####Using Inkscape to make SVG outline filled, to be used by mods.

 - Make an enclosing box on the 'margin' layer in kicad, outside of the edge cut by about 0.050" (~1 mm).
 - Export svg from Kicad, Black and White, board area only, All layers in a single file.
 - Open in Inkscape.  Note that the drawing area is that of the margin.
 - Set fill to black, using Fill and Stroke settings.
 - Make two new layers (Layer -> add layer)
 - Place traces in one, outline in another. (right click -> move to layer)
 - Hide traces
 - Go to node editing mode (Choose arrow icon that selects nodes - second down on left)
 - Shift select all segments, one at a time.
 - drag select nodes (two at a time) at intersections of segments.
 - use icon (fourth from left) to combine nodes.
 - Now you should have fill.  You may need to select object and go back and fiddle with Fill settings.  sometimes I need to try gradient fill before the solid one works.  This means I'm still doing something that I don't understand!
 
####Save traces, outlines, and other output in separate simple SVG files, using 'save as'.

####Open svg program in mods

 - Load traces. Invert.
 - Load outline.  Invert.

####Alternate way that is simpler

 - Make edge cuts larger than desired board size by one endmill diameter (0.031").
 - Export svgs in the usual way.
 - Import svg into mods.  Invert, so that interior is black.  One endmmill worth of black will be cut away.
