###Assembly of XC-union.

This is the union of x Carriage and the Simple Spindle.

The x-carriage is comprised of a Bottom Plate, Face Plate, Motor Plate, and Top Plate.

The assembly works best as follows:

 - Place nylon nuts in all parts, using a long M4 screw to pull them into place as needed. <p>![pic001](./xc_union/assy001.jpg)</p>
 - Assemble Bottom and face plates. <p>![pic002](./xc_union/assy002.jpg)</p>
 - Add screws and bearings to assembly.  <p>![pic003](./xc_union/assy003.jpg)</p>
 - Add motor plate and top plate to the assembly. <p>![pic004a](./xc_union/assy004a.jpg)</p>
 - Below is the assembled result, showing mount for z-motor. <p>![pic005](./xc_union/assy005.jpg)</p>
 - Mount z motor/leadscrew and add nut as it's going together. <p>![pic006](./xc_union/assy006.jpg)</p>
 - Now add spindle carriage (gray in this picture), attaching z-nut to carriage with three long m3 screws. <p>![pic007](./xc_union/assy007.jpg)</p>
 - Thread z-rail through linear bearings and clamps to complete spindle carriage attachment. <p>![pic008](./xc_union/assy008.jpg)</p>
