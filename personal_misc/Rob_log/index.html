### Tuesday June 5, 2018.

####Planning

- Plan to prep for Waring tomorrow:
  - Get laser cutter working and explore box making.
  - Try machining from an STL (Waring and my own).
  - Silicone design for tentacle:
    - Design mold for half-round
    - machine mold and pour tentacle.
    - Try inner tube version.
  - Install Sketchup on a few computers.
  - Set up Arduino to move air.


- Other things we might do.
  - make SDM finger actuator.
  - show  my machine
  - Laser cut gears using mods?


#### Actual stuff done

[site that saves designs as DXF, compatible with thunderlaser](http://jeromeleary.com/laser/)

### Wednesday June 6, 2018.

Waring students did some good work in a few hours:

- Cut mold for three-finger design of Phoebe and Rebecca on Shopbot.
- Cut mold for one-finger design made by Noah and friend during the day.
- Someone learned Fusion 360 and designed a mold for a "tentacle" type actuator.
- Francis learned about mold release, and took a can home.
- Rich and students cut and glued boxes on the laser cutter.  [This site](http://jeromeleary.com/laser/)
- Two students created a mold for the hinged finger design.
- Rich prepared a design for a bending actuator using a silicone tube.
- The group saw how to pump up the device with a little MPJA diaphragm pump (also demonstrated Arduino control).  Took a pump home.
- We ended with a show of my three-axis machine from the MIT class.

### Thursday June 7, 2018.  Friday 6/8/18

[Javascript learning:](../Javascript/index.html)

Summer project thoughts

- Javascript in general, and in particular for use in mods and with serial, and HTML canvas.
- Crochet machine.  Chain stich to make long cable.
  - Needle: rotation and extension.
  - Yarn: Rotation, tension.
  - Roller to feed out finished product and locate stich.


### Monday, June 18, 2018.

### Saturday June 30, 2018

Another look at ITP Physical computerg from Tom Igoe: [here](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/)

Ways to connect serial port to computer:

- P5.js, [link to <b>Tom Igoe page</b>](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-input-to-the-p5-js-ide/)
- Python is easy
- MATLAB
- Processing
- Native JS through serialport.js and websocket

### Monday July 2, 2018
[SPI project](file:///Users/roberthart/Desktop/__working/SPI_SD/index.html)

### Saturday July 7, 2018

3D printer repair last week.

 - Get Sindoh replacement connector for head heater and for bed heater cable.

SPI projects.

Plan for spring course.

###Sunday December 30, 2018

####Look at bee monitoring possiblities.

 - BuzzBox [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/181034265/buzzbox-advanced-beehive-sensor-and-smartphone-app)
 related to Fablab Barcelona and others?  I think audio monitoring and wireless links.  They incorporate the Fablab logo in their
 product. With permission?  List of names here for possible contact.

 - See Paul Stamets short piece in NYT Sunday 12/30/18.  He sees mushroom extract improving bee resistance to viruses (of course).
 Needs to develop a bee feeder with monitoring of visits and pollen load.  Sounds like a good project.

###Wednesday Jan 2, 2019.

  - Files [here](/Users/roberthart/Documents/eagle/projects/Temperature)
  - Looks like Flash memory on AVR is not so easy, and limited in cycles.  See [this](https://github.com/cmaglie/FlashStorage)


- Theremin project is here: /Users/roberthart/Documents/eagle/projects/Theremin

- nrf24L01 Kicad project is [here](../fabClass2018/nrf24l01/rf24_tiny44)  See also [notes on rf24l01](../fabClass2018/nrf24l01/index.html)

###Jan 9, 2019

Thermistor should make a simple anemometer.  Can start with our SMT ones.  Probably can use 1k thermistor to get reasonable heating.
See Wed. Jan 9 browser history for thesis on this topic from uk.  May

###Jan 10, 2019

Interesting book on embedded systems [here](https://proquest-safaribooksonline-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/book/programming/9781449308889)

###Jan 11, 2019

Tried RTD (Platinum, R increases with T) 1kOhm thermistor.  16V, use 6 Ohm sense.  See 10% current drop in light wind.
This should be more sensitive when run in const. T mode.  Smaller device faster and more sensitive as well.
Will try 100 Ohm NTC device in small package, ordered from Digikey.

###Jan 18,2019

For driving nine solenoids, made nine=FET board with two 10-pin headers.
See Eaglep poject.

###Mar 12, 2019

Notes on Eagle board for double motor driver:
Holes for power connectors and motor connectors are on "milling" layer.  Something already on holes layer that
gets in the way.

1.  Traces includes top and pads.
2.  holes is on milling layer.
3.  Outline is from bottom.

###April 30,2019

Video series from a guy who made a generator from auto brake discs and bearing hub, with NdFeB magnets and
copper windings.  This is great:  [muddymuddymuddmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pVYworg8t4)

Found fifty_springs video. uploaded to you tube [here](https://youtu.be/UO3L12oqGy0)

Could I make an EDM?  See [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpHYBz7ToII)

Installing Xubuntu 18.04 on old macbook which does not run Macos very well.
[here](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-install-linux-on-mac-3637265/)

This works.

###May 8, 2019

Looking at chips and modules for serial control of sound files:[here]
(https://www.adafruit.com/product/2342?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_fSHjf6L4gIVEp6fCh1JOQ53EAQYAyABEgJtePD_BwE)

Probably best to sit down with Jim on this topic.

###May 8, 2019

Lab organization.

###July 9, 2019

Deep Cove, Sunshine, ME.

Gimp notes
  - Repeated use of threshold and blur, together with selecting and clearing makes a nice way to capture a black and white png image.
  -

Converting 2D bitmaps to stl?
  - Try Fusion 360.  [add-in](https://github.com/hanskellner/Fusion360Image2Surface) convert to mesh, then use T-spline.

Notes on my history and direction - see little book.

Looking at SAMx1 chips.

  - Adafruit [Itsy bitsy m4 express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800)  I have four of these!
  - ItsyBitsy has ATSAMD51 chip + a bunch of flash.  runs Circuitpython, Arduino, ......  Pretty amazing.
  - This is a good solution for Audio, should be able to run a camera.

[Book on ARM Cortex M0 and 0+](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/library/view/the-definitive-guide/9780128032787/XHTML/B9780128032770000023/B9780128032770000023.xhtml)

###Oct. 21, 2020

####Email from Haystack re Fab Academy.

####  Notes on fab class staff meeting, review of Electronics design, lecture on programming.

Fab academy belgium student made SAMD11 UPDI programmer:  [quentin-bolsee](http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/ulb/students/quentin-bolsee/assignments/week09/)

Fabcloud hello-worlds.  Where?

I now have fab.io access, which gets to https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/ which is the Fab Academy site.

https://www.media.mit.edu/people/alims/overview/  Ali Starbanov was the student last year who developed a flow module.

Good documentation from Omar on machine running.

Looks like Eagle now does not offer a non-connected version.  Not sure how to export images.

###Oct. 23, 2020

Serial on Arduino core for t412.

Use Neil's echo code.  Arduino 1.8.12.  Konde Mega tiny core 2.1.3.  Serial TX appears on pin 2.
Looks like from Konde [page](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/ATtiny_x12.md) that
current version of the core sets UART on physical pins 2/3.  To use with (physical) pins 4/5, call Serial.swap(1).
So [this](hello.t412.echo.swapped.ino) modification works with Neil's board example.

###Oct 26, 2020

The documentation on the 412 counter timer is good.  See [getting started](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/TB3217-Getting-Started-with-TCA-90003217A.pdf) note from
Microchip.

###Nov. 2, 2020
