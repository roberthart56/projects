 ### various tips.

 - np.arange lets you choose beginning value and increment
 - np.linspace chooses beginning and end values and number of elements.
 - See Chapter 2 on array slicing and shaping.
 - especially nice is using lists, arrays, and booleanexpressions
  to select elements of an array.
 ### examples
 - Jupyter notebook.  Uses Serial_test.c to send 0-F data at 9600 to serial.
 - Also use Spyder, launched most easily from terminal window.
