Pizza oven, using gas still, and Hamelman crust with less kneading and long cold ferments.  Better results. 

Plan to work wih Neil's machine class this spring.

Run around Fresh Pond -  seven miles?

 ### Jan 6
 
 Document LEDs in vials [here](https://github.com/roberthart56/projects/tree/master/Vial_lights).
 
 Dinner in Ooni since oven was not behaving.  Veggies roasted and salmon charred.  Wood and charcoal give good control, but pretty fast burning to keep hot.
 
 ### Jan 7
 
 Measure saddle height(x,y) for four saddles.   Next, get python scripts working to extract parameters.  Then mount and measure.
 
 Talked with David Selles about Possible Project.  Makerspace coming up next summert.  Fab Academy soon?

 ### Jan 8
 
 Set up Jupyter notebook on MacBook Ubuntu.  Learn some more python to fit curves and correct for measurement tool radius.  Will document in link above.
 
 Attend MAS865 meeting (How to make something that makes....).  notes [here](https://github.com/roberthart56/projects/blob/master/Machines2021/README.md)
 
 ### Jan 11-13
 
 Work on Saddle data with P2 and P3.  Reload MacBook with Ubuntu20 and install new driver.
 
 ### Jan 14
 
Learn a good deal about FreeCad.  I like the Python and the community.  Pretty functional.  

### Jan 15-17

Still much to figure out about Freecad.  I think it may be secondary to Fusion for complex things.

###  Jan 18

[Orange marmalade.](../../Cooking/README.md)

Repair Food processor bowl.  [Documentation](../../home/food

Took data to complete dataset for four plastic saddles.  The points seem to fit.  We'll see what's next.



###  Jan 20

Learned VIM a bit.  Could be useful.
Worked on Ender3.  Installed new fittings.  Made first print.

###  Jan 21

Work on plotting saddle data in matplotlib.


###  Jan 25

Document work on assembling and testing [Ender-3 3D printer](../../Machines2021/Ender3/README.md)

Swap igniters in oven to fix heating problem.

Talk with Louis about [saddles](https://github.com/roberthart56/SCFAB/tree/master/SC_lab/Projects/rotating_saddle).  Several things to do to help me understand, and to make our paper better.   

Assemble Sainsmart Genmitsu router.  [document here](../../Machines2021/genmitsu/README.md)
