###Atmel Studio

4/22/20  got successful project with tiny45. on Alienware computer Atmel 7.

Did not succeed in programming ATSAMD11 to blink an LED, although I managed to erase the existing bootloader.  Tried Neil's code from class webpage for blink, using both the infrastructure from the Atmel default project and neil's code bare.  The ICE communicates with the chip.  Looks like it should work.

Possible tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhvPKiICbf8)

Next:

 - Check Jakes pages for examples of projects.
 - Look over Eric's materials for HTMAA
 - Glance at Neils page.
 - Try using Atmel to load bootloader, following adafruit tutorial.
 - Try openocd again on mac or linux.

Pinout for boards [here:](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/Microcontrollers/HTMAA_micros/index.html)

###Fall 2021

####Work with openocd on Linux to load bootloader.

[Eric’s page link for D11 bootloader](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/pub/hello-world/atsamd11/-/tree/master/bootloader)
This still works.  [See my page here, for instance](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/Microcontrollers/ATSAMD11/samD11_rob/index.html)
Openocd now installed on my Asus laptop linux side, following instructions on openocd website.  It works with either the ICE programmer or the MAX32625 board.

Want to make sure it still works in the lab on the chromebox or similar.

####Using edbg to load bootloader.

(See Neil video for use of edbg.)[http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/D11C/hello.D11C.serial.3V3.mp4]
(EDBG github.)[https://github.com/ataradov/edbg]

 - Clone repo.
 - Use ‘make all’
 - Execute binary using ‘./edbg …..’

####Using Arduino IDE
