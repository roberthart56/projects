Now look at motor board, work on program to get and send values.

analog in PB3
serial_pin_in PB0  interrupt on this pin.
serial_pin_out PB2

###Nov. 2, 2019

Modify 45.echo.interrupt.c

- disable interrupt in ISR byt clearing PCI0 bit.
- get char from serial in.
- set up PWM for PB1, OC0B
- set PWM duty cycle by equating OCR0B to char.

###Dec 2019

Work with gearmotors and pwm.  Problem encountered when gearmotors start up.  Motors draw enough current to pull down supply
force micro to restart.  Doesn't help to add caps.  Add 10 Ohm in series.  This works to  keep micro alive, but drops some voltage and
dissipates power.  Tried Jameco motor that works at higher voltage and has higher resistance.  Same issue.

Next, separate micro power supply from motor supply.  Thought I tried this without success.  Try again.

###Dec 4, 2019.

Separating motor supply helps.  Power with 0-12V benchtop supply.  Power logic from 5V FTDI module.
They still share ground on the board.  Use larger transistor to handle startup transients.  This seems to work reliably now.  If necessary,
isolate grounds and use choke in line with motor ground (if necessary)?

###Jan 12, 2020.

New board.  Still have problems with startups.  Even with micro isolated, using FTDI power supply, it still resets when starting
at a low PWM fraction from a stop.

### Jan 14, 2020.

Better with Jameco motor.  Problem is that the gearing makes it harder to turn by hand.  May not work for box.

Reliapro 253471  5V no load 60 RPM at 0.08A  Works better.  Do a faster PWM, with 2 ms period.
Other motor from MPJA  pn 19285 MD 5V 240 RPM no load 0.16A.

See if h-bridge works better.  Yes, it does.  [Code here](./ATSAM_code/samd11_hbridge01/samd11_hbridge01.ino)
Boyoyboy I like these sams.

###Jan 16, 2020

Made h-bridge board with SAMD11, with 2x2 headers for USART and ADC.  Look out!  Killed a board by using 5V FTDI.

Programs for ATSAMD11 are in ATSAM_code directory.
Most success with   ATSAM_code/samd11_hbridge_03.ino which sets motor speed accoridng to difference between setpoint
and potentiometer reading.  When pot is connected to motor, with correct sign, feedback seeks (and overshoots) the
setpoint.
