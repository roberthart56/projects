Tried RTD (Platinum, R increases with T) 1kOhm thermistor.  16V, use 6 Ohm sense.  See 10% current drop in light wind.
This should be more sensitive when run in const. T mode.  Smaller device faster and more sensitive as well.
Will try 100 Ohm NTC device in small package, ordered from Digikey.

Soldered up the 0402 NTC 100 Ohm thermistor.

Used NTC thermistor 0402 as a wind sensor.  Works conveniently near 5V.

![Notebook page](NTC_0402_Thermistor.jpg)

Notebook page.  Use 18 Ohm sense resistor.  Resistance of thermistor falls from 109 at 21C to about 4 Ohms when
it dissipates about 0.2W at 3.7 Ohm.  Then when fan blows, the voltage on the sense resistor falls as the resistance
of the thermistor increases.  This gives a "const. voltage" method that is easy to apply.

![time_response](./Response_thermistor.png)
Full horizontal frame about 70 seconds.  Response to blowing.
Recovery tau ~6 sec.
Note that thermistor is soldered to wires that are of diameter close to that of thermistor.  Not well isolated thermally.

Applied to Arduino, average 1000 points.  [arduino sketch](./AnalogReadSerial_N_ave)


![Constant_temp](Const_temp.jpg)

If we implement a constant Temp. circuit/algorithm, we'll get 20% voltage
change, as opposed to ~10% change in current under const-applied voltage method.


Next:

- import and plot thermistor data:  csv - list - array.  See nelson book.
- make circuitboard to get better thermal isolation.
