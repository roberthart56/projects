### Wedding Arbors!

One hope is to grow some vines that could be planted at the site, as the arbor is installed in May.  The picture below is of moonflower in Arlington on Sept 24. There might be enough rain and sun in the summer to grow some moon flowers and scarlet runner beans in Brooksville if we get an early start in buckets at home in April.

In the garden at Matt and Liz's house is this arbor.  It might make sense to draw some features of this into our arbor at the wedding site.

And here is the arbor from Jack and Meredith's wedding.

Here are some designs, generated in the CAD program Onshape:

Below, built with dimensioned lumber.  4x4's and 2x6's.  Cut in shapes to reflect the garden arbor horizontal members.

Below, thinking about using recycled beams of about the same dimension, but not as regular.

This is what is might look like to use parts of trees.

Here, I've constructed 3.5"x3.5" board from recycled pallet lumber, and added a recycled cedar top piece.  Oil stains, various shades and  strengths to see what it would look like.  The stain on the closeup is 5:1 chestnut:walnut, thinned.
