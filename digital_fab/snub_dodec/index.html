## Vertex hubs for Snub Dodecahedron

My notes from Glenn's CAD file, imported into Fusion 360.

Pictures of milling setup and finished vertex prototype.  Milling was easy, once setup done.  Less easy to cut off
hubs at 13 degrees - need to make a custom cutoff tool. Then it should be easy.  The tubes I got for arms were oversized.
Better to get higher precision stock.

If this prototype is used, it needs to have arms glued in.  A good epoxy should work.  This adds a lot of labor!


###Time?

  - Setup 1hr.
  - Drill 120 * 5 holes: 2 hr.  (machinist)
  - Cut off 120 hubs: 2 hr. (machinist)
  - Cut 120 * 5 arms: 2 hr. (machinist)
  - Glue 120 x 5 arms: 2 hr. (less-skilled)
  - Drill/slot or otherwise prepare arms for clamping: 2 hr (less-skilled)
  Total ~10 hours.

###Materials

  - Delrin 1.5"  $10 per foot.
  - Delrin tube OD 5/8" x ID 3/8"  $6 per foot
  - clamps $0.35 each.  McMaster 5246K86

###Simpler design?

Should be possible to use 1.5" delrin, with no "arms", then make 120 with ~6 hours labor.
And only ~6 feet of Delrin rod for material cost $600.

###Conclusions???

It would cost 5-10 dollars per vertex, even with my naive estimates.
With a one-piece design, close to $7.50

###Simpler design May 8-9, 2019

Machined two delrin hubs to accept 3/8" dowels directly.  Note that I used an undersized (~.360) endmill, but had undersized dowels that
fit with some friction.  If this is done seriously, need to match dowels and holes with known tolerance, etc....

Made a cutoff tool to accomodate angle.

Tried to compress the hub from the center, using 1/4-20 nuts and washers.  Doesn't seem to work well.

One alternative is to drill a hole and use self-tapping screws.  Best would be to use self-tap screw with torx driver, like
[this McMaster-carr item](https://www.mcmaster.com/90925a146).

Glenn suggests pins instead, which should work well.  The only problem with either suggestion is having to drill 120x5 holes!

This is  looking more practical.  With programmed mill, could probably make a bunch of these in a few hours.
Since each hub uses 0.625 inch of 1.5" rod, material cost is now $0.50 per hub.

I split the hub to see if all dowels could be clamped at once.  This did not work well - clamping was uneven.  Might work
by leaving more material on the top, and a large washer on the bottom.
