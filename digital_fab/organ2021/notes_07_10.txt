Notes from first in-person meeting:
- Today had us inspecting the loft producing sound out of loft speakers using playing from Hauptwerk Installation  on R's laptop. 
Sounds quite nice though we will need more amplification.
- Somewhat down the road but may want to consult with Regathering Committee (henceforth RC) re: small antiphonal (front of church) speakers for reed stops etc.
- agreed MVP is two manual system playing Hauptwerk through altar speaker system. C would like to have this in place soon and potentially try playing with choir to 
test for sight lines/coordination as well as sound.
- seems we would like to try Novation Launchpad instead of touchscreen for stops/presets.
- Once MVP can be demonstrated would be important to update vestry re: future planes
- may want to discuss with RC about sound issues as there has been discussion on their part of replacing soundboard.
- C would like to undertake pedal midifying ASAP though unsure how it's done. WIll do more research

for next time:

R will work on driving sound to loft and altar speakers either alternately or together
C will work to get midi to drive  from the existing dual manual keyboard at church.
C will research next steps / what to order for midifying pedals
C will 'ask around'. Seeing out other local Hauptwerk churches/hobbyists for expertise/feedback.
