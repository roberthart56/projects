This is the error that i get when programming some chips.  Chips that have been programmed with OpenOCD????


$ ./edbg -b -t samd11 -epv -f sam_ba_SAMD11C14A.bin 
Debugger: Alex Taradov Generic CMSIS-DAP Adapter 759A4BFC v0.1 (S)
Clock frequency: 16.0 MHz
Target: SAM D11C14A (Rev B)
Erasing... done.
Programming.... done.
Verification...
at address 0x0 expected 0xfc, read 0xff
Error: verification failed


same command works well when a fresh chip is used.


Now, when bootloader is installed, and a program uploaded in Arduino, the program does not run, and the micro disappears as a usb device.  This so far is in LINUX.

Works better in windows.  I re-bootloaded, using sam_ba_SAMD11C14A  bootloader with edbg in windows.  Now can program using Arduino.  Quentin's code works, blink works.
