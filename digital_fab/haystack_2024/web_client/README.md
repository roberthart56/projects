Getting data from NOAA:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2

My web token sent to my email:  rdUkcsSqSGLwTFMQYYoDrltxCFLOgJIV

Simpler requests described here:  https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api
These are use in examples from gpt and Nathan

Good python documentation for requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/


Was not able to get this to work on MP:  got denial of access messages from MP, while same code in python had success at getting and parsing website.  To be continued.


1/29/24.  Used Nathan's example to get an integer value of temperature.  Can work with this to make a device to show windspeed with servo, for example.  See Arduino folder.
