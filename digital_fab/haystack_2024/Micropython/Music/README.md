### What I've tried as of  2/22/24

Microcontroller circuit actuated by buttons or photodiode(s).
3D printed part to accept tapes.
RP2040 Micropython to send string, e.g. '1 on', '1 off', etc.
Python on computer to play sound.
Use Audacity to record and save wav files.  Audacity specrogram is nice.
Use calculated wav files or recorded sounds.
