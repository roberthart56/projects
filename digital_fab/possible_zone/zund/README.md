### Workflow for Zund.

For doing parametric design, use Onshape, converting to DXF, opening a mm-scaled document in Ai, using the "File -> Place" command in Ai to place the vectors.  This seems to be fine.  It is easier to make parameter-driven designs in CAD software, and easier to use Ai to talk to machines.

Here are some tricks for operating in Onshape:

* make an array of points in the sketch, separated by a length parameter.
* copy the points to blank sketches.
* draw lines between these points.
* use sketch fillets to join or separate squares as needed.

Once these are placed in Ai:

* use snap to grid to keep them located.
* place in differenct layers.
* make desired layer visible and save as Ai file.
