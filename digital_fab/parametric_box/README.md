Exported base rectangles for box parts.


Use sketch to generate shopbot toolpaths for box with endmill and 90 degree v-bit.
Make and try.
Use python to generate parameter-based toolpaths.


1/29/24  Try elmwood box.  Tape method is OK, but get glue on edges.
Many problems with locating cuts and defining endmill diams!  
Check model - some dimensions seem wrong!
