##PWM on tiny44.

###TC1 16 bit.

In phase correct PWM, can have top defined by ICR1 which set freqency.
Then duty cycle can be set with OCR1A, as in Neil's hello.servo.44.c example.

I use Fast PWM with toggle of OC1A pin at each top for 50% duty cycle at variable frequency.  Top set by ICR1 register.

###TC0 8 bit.

In Fast PWM, set WGM to mode 3 (011). Then top is fixed at 255, and duty cycle can vary with OCR0A.  I hope.

In Phase correct PWM,  cannot do the same trick of controlling both frequency and duty cycle.
