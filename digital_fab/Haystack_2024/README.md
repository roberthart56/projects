# Haystack2024  Residency Notes

## Topics

 - [Parametric box](../parametric_box/).  A CAD file that uses width, depth, height, stock thickness, and end mill diamter to create a box design that can be cut on the shopbot.

 - [Extruder pedal](../Extruder_pedal_control/).  A control pedal that is built into the Precious Plastics speed control box for the plastic extruder machine.

 - [Music box](Music) activity.  Janet has introduced a wonderful tape-driven music box.  We will cut new tapes with our own compositions.  This is already a mix of analog and digital ways to make music.  We can also mix it up further by adding recorded sounds and electronics.

 - [Climate Stripes](./climate_stripes/).  Kim Bernard has made me aware of this project to present visual representations of climate data.  I would like to explore programming strips of LEDs that pull climate data to make the image dynamic (on a scale of years, anyway).
