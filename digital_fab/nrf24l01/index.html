## Nrf24lo1

###Dec 10

got example working with Arduino from RF24 library.

Some approaches:

1.  Use RF24 libary with t44.  Uses USI.  Pins constrained.

2.  Follow website from Fab Academy [(torino):](http://archive.fabacademy.org/2016/fablabtorino/students/440/exercises/W15/net.html)
This gives a software SPI example.  I like the looks of it.

3.  Use this to complete Neil's library.

At least i think I understand enough to know which way to go on this.  It would be good to have
a simple nrf solution.s

###Jan 2019

Already started KICAD project to attach tiny44 to nrf24L01 in configuration that is compatible with RF24 libraries
but can also be used with software solutions.  In fabClass2018/nrf24l01/rf24_tiny44.

 - next step is to add a couple of pins to header, so I can use same header to program t44.
 - alternatively, connect rst and unused IRQ position with a wire!  I like this.
 - would be good to add button as well.  Could hack this in as well, I guess.

###Mar 2019

So far did not reproduce success with RF24 library.
See [this link](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=217865.0) for some dead simple examples.
 Suggest [tmrh20 branch of project](https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/)

 Try updating library using library manager.

 Now, with wires in the right holes, and updated library, it works.
 [rec](./Arduino_nrf/GettingStarted_rec/GettingStarted_rec.ino)
 [xmit](./Arduino_nrf/GettingStarted_xmit/GettingStarted_xmit.ino)

 Make simple program to send a byte.

 [hookup instructions](http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/)

 Code revised from getting started examples:
 [rec](./Arduino_nrf/Simple_rec/Simple_rec.ino)
 [xmit](./Arduino_nrf/Simple_xmit/Simple_xmit.ino)

###Oct 14,2019

Resurrect Arduino Uno send/receive.

[hookup instructions](http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/)

Code previously revised from getting started examples:
[rec](./Arduino_nrf/Simple_rec/Simple_rec.ino)
[xmit](./Arduino_nrf/Simple_xmit/Simple_xmit.ino)

This takes a few tries - too many connections!
Try a few radios, jiggling connections, seems to work most of the time.  Maybe add filter caps on supply.

Look at programming tiny44 with this library.
Use version of [xmit program with serial removed.](./Arduino_nrf/Simple_xmit.t44/Simple_xmit.t44.ino)
This does not load successfully.  Complains about SPI class.

One more reasonable nrf library for AVR [here](https://github.com/antoineleclair/avr-nrf24l01/tree/master/src)
Or maybe better, [this.](https://github.com/kehribar/nrf24L01_plus/blob/master/nrf24.c)

[Downloaded here](./nRF24L01_plus-master)

Looks like this can be used to guide the further development of neil's start to a library.

###Oct 18, 2019

Make Neil's hello-world [nrf24l01 board](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html)
and add a known-working nrf24l01 module.

Now receiving 0xOE from status query.  This looks like the reset value for the status register. (p59) according
to timing diagram on p52 of datasheet.  Looks like status register byte comes back as first byte is being clocked into MOSI.

Look at nRF_01 and nRF04 from my t44 directory (Dec 2016!).

  - nRF_01 incorporates a byte-trade function.  Reads status register.
  - nRF_04 adds a Register read function.  reads the second byte clocked in from radio.
    - CONFIG register comes back as 0x08.
    - Test this on other registers.  EN_AA is 0x3F - verified.
  - nRR_05,06.  Worked on using pointer....?  Why?
  - 07,08,09  added register-writing function.  prototype of data-writing function.  Did not work.

Review this in more detail, and then look at Kehribar example library - rewrite functions to match?

Modified the Kehribar example for my t44 hardware.

  - Modify radioPinFunctions.c to reflect connections to MISO, MOSI, SCK, CE, CS.
  - in main file, change serial out to PA3.
  - after running Makefile, send avrdude command:  avrdude -c usbtiny -p t44 -U flash:w:./obj/main.hex
  - Add lines in main to set the clock divider to 1.
  - I don't follow what's happening with serial, but it works.
  - memory required is 2k, about 50% full for t44. Not bad!
  - t44 responds with "RX device ready".

Modified tx as well.  Now both sides initialize and send a message.

Added our usual put_char and put_string functions and rewrote serial outputs.  All still works! nrf24L021_modified_2.


  - Next, add radio pin function to main
  - then consider how to consolidate more code.
  - Then see if it is possible to make functions less numerous and code more efficient.

###Oct 23

Ported the library into one file and started to translate to the local dialect, to make consistent with
the "hello world" examples.

  - rx works, using the third modification.  [File](./nrf24L01_modified_3/rx_example_mod_2_t44/nrf24l01_combined.c)
  - did not get tx to work in same way.  mod_3 gave type mismatch warnings about variable 'temp' used in put_string function.
  - move back to mod_2.  Now tx works, but does not send serial.

###Oct 27

Now in "combined-3" rx and tx are translated into the usual hello-world dialect, and each program
only contains functions that it needs for rx or tx.

This is not very nice - now I want to separate out the common stuff again, now that I know how it
works and that it works.  I started this in "combined-4" but had to quit.  Just need to learn how to do
this correctly.



Next, trade hardware.  See if problem is in software or hardware.

###Later.  Got these to talk with tiny44.  See HTMAA wesite documentation.

###Jan 17, 2020.

Tried to get simple xmit and receive working with Arduino Uno to no success.  Could not even taok to device.
Using, Adafruit  ItsyBitsy M4 , was able to talk to devices, but no data transfer.  Looks like it is working.  At least it
compiles and sends out a "fail" upon transmit.

###Jan 18-21, 2020

Now able to use ATSAMD11 with Arduino IDE and Mattair bootloader to communicate with radios:
Use "ONE_UART_NO_WIRE_ONE_SPI" with pins 4,5,14,15.  Note that pin 15 is SS (=CS) and that it
does not work if another pin is chosen as CS.
