## Dec. 2019

Stepper board:

  - lead broke at connector.  Beef up trace.
  - Need better connector design - can't use while bolted to motor.  See Jake's connectors.
  - Add capacitors near h-bridge.
  - Move four-pin header away from ISP header.

Successfully ran Neil's code, modified.
Next, program for single steps.  Then program for packets.

Investigated using USB to make a stepper driver network.  I think that USB requires some sort of pairing or master/slave interaction.  Looks like
it will not be easy to set this up.  Try USART with SAM D11.

Prepared files to mill board, using four-pin header for USART and 5V power/gnd connection.  Keep USB MINI as programming connector.

Programmed this board, using [stepper_2](Code/Arduino_SAM/samd11_stepper_2/samd11_stepper_2.ino)

Really nice to be able to program from Arduino IDE, use SerialUSB to monitor from Arduino window, and use USART to network.
With only Arduino talking through USB, the connection is never broken, and there is no problem with serial conflict.  I started by
using FTDI to talk USART, and will move on to using a microcontroller.

Added direction and address to stepper firmware, using ['stepper_3.ino'](Code/Arduino_SAM/samd11_stepper_3/samd11_stepper_3.ino)

USART byte:  MSB, direction.  6-4, address.  3-0, step number.  So to send number 1 positive 15, send 0x9F.

Added program for a USB Arduino board, for a [square](Code/Arduino_SAM/itsy_bitsy_contoller_square/itsy_bitsy_contoller_square.ino)
and a [spiral square](Code/Arduino_SAM/itsy_bitsy_contoller_square_spiral/itsy_bitsy_contoller_square_spiral.ino)

Added program to conrol x and y independently using two potentiometers. [Sketcher Code here](./Code/Arduino_SAM/x_y_sketcher/x_y_sketcher.ino)
